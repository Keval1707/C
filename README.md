# C 
These are common programming functions that perform various tasks such as calculating the factorial of a number, generating Fibonacci series, checking if a number is a palindrome or prime, reducing the sum of digits to a single-digit number, reversing a number, and implementing recursion

## Descriptions

#### Armstrong_Number :
  This function checks if a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number whose sum of cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself.

#### DigitSumReducedToOne :
 This function recursively calculates the sum of the digits of a given number until a single digit number is obtained. This final single digit is returned as the output.

#### Factorial :
 This function calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers up to and including that number.

#### Fibonacci_Series :
 This function generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a given limit. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

#### Palidrome_number :
 This function checks whether a given number is a palindrome or not. A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.

#### Prime_number :
 This function checks whether a given number is a prime number or not. A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.

#### Recursive :
 This function is a simple example of a recursive function. It calls itself repeatedly until a base case is reached and then returns the final result.

#### Result_with_if_else_leader :
 This function returns the result of a simple arithmetic operation using if-else conditions.

#### Reverse_number :
 This function reverses a given number. It can be used to reverse the digits of a number.

#### Sum_of_array :
 This function calculates the sum of all elements in an array.

#### Sum_of_digits :
 This function calculates the sum of the digits of a given number.

#### Swap_two_number :
 This function swaps the values of two given variables.

#### Without use main :
 This function is an alternative way to run C code without using the traditional main function. It uses a preprocessor directive to define a custom entry point for the program.

#### Without use semicolon :
 This function demonstrates that C statements can be separated using other characters besides semicolons. It uses line breaks and the comma operator to separate statements
